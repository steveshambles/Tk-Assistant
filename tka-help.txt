Tk Assistant V2.05 Quick Start help.
------------------------------------
Choose an item from one of the drop-down combo boxes. 

When you click the "GET" button to the right of your selection  
the code will be copied to your clipboard.
 
You can now paste that code into your Python editor and 
edit or run the code.
 
You will also be given the option to execute the code 
from within Tk Assistant so that you can see a quick 
demo what that widget does and how it works.

The toolbar at the top of the GUI has icons that are 
mostly self explanatory, but If you move the mouse 
pointer over an icon it will explain what it does 
via a tooltip message.
 
As an example, click on the blue folder icon, 
"View squirts folder".
This will take you via your systems default file viewer
to where the "Squirts" used in Tk Assistant are stored. 
Here you can use the squirts like any other .py file 
if you want to.

You can also send me a message, or visit my Python blogs, 
which are chock full of hundreds of bits of useful source 
code and articles for beginners.

Let me know if you found Tk Assistant useful, or if you have
constructive criticisms or ideas.

If you find TK Assistant useful and would like me to keep working
on improving and expanding it, please consider making a small
donation via the drop-down menu.
